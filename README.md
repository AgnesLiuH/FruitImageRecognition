# FruitImageRecognition
a. How to use it?
Users just download the folder, then use Xcode to open it and run. The only thing you need to pay attention is that the Xcode version should be more than 10.1, and the mac OS version should be more than 10.14. 

b. The Composition of the App
There are several folders. 
The Model folder is the trained model and some tools to train the model.
The FruitImageRecgnition folder is the main application.

c. In this App, I used some useful tools and refered some websites, and I list them here. Thank you so much!
